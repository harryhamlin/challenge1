# Challenge 01: Cleaning Up Code

## Introduction

The purpose of this challenge was to familiarize me with improving the accessibility of an existing piece of code. I did this through a number of techniques, detailed below. This challenge was due on Nov 10, 2022.

## Techniques Used

I employed the use of alt attributes, a discriptive title, semantic HTML elements, the logical structuring of such elements.

## Examples of Use

Many css attributes were redundant and coule be more simply placed in the css file as either attribute selectors or removed entirely.

Many of the HTML sections were dividing using <div> elements. In order to increase accessibility, I replaced many of them with <section> <aside> <nav> etc to be more accessible.
